## Gamradt's Persona Notes
  - What the app should be similar to: Cottonwood POS APP on iPad
  - App is intended to run on iOS (Gamradt is very apple heavy)
  - App Iterations:
    - App first iteration is to put on the counter and add items that the customer wants (FOCUS ON THIS STAGE)
    - Second interation would be to do a kiosk in the store where customers can serve themselves
    - Third iteration would be to put it on a customers phone and can place orders from there
  - Focus on bagels first and them do coffee
  - Questions from Monday (4/1)
    - Q: Should we have a lot of prompts for each order addition? A: No, in my opinion I would have the final list be the double check. (the order confirmation)
    - Q: Specific color or design. A: Not part of design for functionality. Wait for final preliminary discussion
    - Q: Only bagels, not coffee? A: Just bagels, can put like "Coffee coming Summer 2019", can put item in for plain black coffee. Do get carried away.
    - Q: Just of a POS? A: For now its a POS but later its going to be converted into a kiosk system
    - Q: Tip? A: Yes, the purchasing should follow the tip (right before signature). Like Cottonwood.  Flip it around, add tip, swipe card, sign,  option to have recipt printed or emailed
    - Q: Payment processing? You can add in an api for payment functionality (like square)

## Assignment 4
  - Prototyping tool: [AdobeXD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html)

  > Note: AdobeXD does not allow for collaborations. After your done editing the XD file, make sure to push it to github so others can work on it.
