## Gamradt's Persona Notes
  - What the app should be similar to: Cottonwood POS APP on iPad
  - App is intended to run on iOS (Gamradt is very apple heavy)
  - App Iterations:
    - App first iteration is to put on the counter and add items that the customer wants (FOCUS ON THIS STAGE)
    - Second interation would be to do a kiosk in the store where customers can serve themselves
    - Third iteration would be to put it on a customers phone and can place orders from there
  - Focus on bagels first and them do coffee
